File mover/renamer: `_dark@2x` to `@2x_dark`, to rename files from discontinued Slicy from
[macrabbit]. It also applies to Adobe Illustrator exported file names.

Optionally removes plugin identifier from `plugin.xml` editor tab to reduce tab size, and does
the same for project name in gradle build and gradle settings file editor tabs.
